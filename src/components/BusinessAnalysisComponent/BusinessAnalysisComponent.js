              As the name suggest, it's all about analysis of data but it is not
              a one-step process. Business analysis involves collecting,
              sorting, processing, and inspecting the raw data using many ways
              and tools to convert the data into information and further using
              that information to understand the demand of consumers. This will
              eventually help us to introduce new ideas in your business.
