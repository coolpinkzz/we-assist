                  selling and lightweight items to your ecommerce website. Also,
                  consider what items shoppers inquire about or request the
                  most. This way, you may be able to find new products that will
                  increase the sales of your store.

            <h2>5. Get your legal ducks in a row :</h2>
            <p>
              The legal stuff seems opaque and boring, but it’s make or break
              for your company. Avoiding legal troubles when you’re starting up
              is all about being proactive and preventing issues before they
              occur. Here’s six things to think about on the legal side of life.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <li>Business license</li>
            </h4>
            <p>
              There’s no dedicated license for an online business. This means
              you can use the same license that was issued when you registered
              your brick-and-mortar or LLC. However, you may have to apply for a
              Home Occupation Permit if you plan to run the business from home.
              The SBA’s list of state licenses and permits can help you identify
              one specific to your location.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <li>DBA license</li>
            </h4>
            <p>
              If your online business is going to operate under a different name
              than your traditional company, you will need to get a DBA (Doing
              Business As) license. You can apply for a DBA with your state
              government based on where your business is incorporated.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <li>Tax obligations</li>
            </h4>
            <p>
              You will also need to register for an EIN (employee identification
              number) so that the IRS can tax you on your transactions.
              Additionally, you might need to collect sales tax if you plan to
              sell goods or services in a sales/use tax state.
            </p>
            <h4>
              <li>Data privacy</li>
            </h4>
            <p>
              If your business collects customer’s information, you will have to
              display a privacy policy that explains what you will or will not
              do with that information. Also, you may have to comply with GDPR
              laws which require you to put up a disclaimer regarding the
              collection of personal information.
            </p>
            <h2>6. Add content to your website:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Content is crucial to moving your business online. Because
                  people won’t be able to visit you in person, the only way to
                  help them get an idea of your business is to write good
                  content. Add content on the key pages of your website so that
                  people can learn your story as well as get familiar with your
                  products or services.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  While you can create and add content on an unlimited number of
                  pages, focus on your:
                </p>
                <p>1. Home page</p>
                <p>2. About Us page</p>
                <p>3. Product/service page</p>
                <p>4. Returns & Refunds page</p>

                  Capturing readers’ interests in this exploding digital
                  universe can be immensely challenging. Good website writing is
                  the key to beating these statistics. Well-written content
                  that’s optimized for the web rises to the top of search
                  results and holds readers’ attention
                </p>

                  Making it as easy as possible for your customers to pay is
                  essential for increasing conversions and sales.In order to
                  kickstart your online sales, you need to be able to take
                  payments from your customers

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is why your checkout page is critical. It’s the final
                  stop for people shopping on your website. It’s the place where
                  they hand over their credit card information and finally part
                  with their hard-earned cash. "Yourcheckout page is where
                  window shoppers become paying customers."

                <p>
                  Announcing a launch appropriately is nearly as important as
                  the launch itself. Without proper awareness of an upcoming
                  brand or website launch, it won’t matter how innovative the
                  new strategy, look or functionality is if no one is around to
                  see it.

                  Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and any other platform your
                  business has a social profile on. Include a link back to your
                  website to get eyeballs on your new identity. Additionally,
                  tailor content to each platform (like making a fun, casual
                  announcement via an Instagram Story) so you can reach
                  audiences far and wide.

                  Search engines: Though it takes time to establish a presence
                  in search engines, you should start working on SEO as soon as
                  you get your business online. The easiest way to do this is to
                  research what keywords people use when searching for similar
                  businesses. Insert these keywords throughout your site’s copy
                  as well as in the “Alt” section of your images.

                  Influencers: When is the last time a customer came to your
                  business because of someone else’s referral? When starting
                  out, consider partnering with influencers to spread the word
                  about your business. Work with smaller influencers than big
                  names as they’re more effective at getting people to engage
                  and act upon their recommendations.
