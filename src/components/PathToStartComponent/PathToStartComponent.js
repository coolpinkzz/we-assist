          <p>
            Being a part of a startup team is uniquely exciting – it provides
            opportunities and experiences that established corporations simply
            can't match. It's a rush, and with the right people, it can be the
            time of your life. There's a dark side to startups, though – because
            no one knows what the future holds, working for one can be somewhat
            frightening. We're not your leaders, we will do absolutely anything
            to keep you motivated and help you fight through feelings of
            apprehension.

            2. Your sales funnel illustrates the path prospects take.
            Understanding your funnel can helps you find the holes in the funnel
            — the places where prospects drop out and never convert. If you
            don’t understand your sales funnel, you can’t optimize it.
          </p>
